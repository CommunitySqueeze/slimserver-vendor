Please see the README file for more info about this encoder.

Shine can be used on non-floating-point systems such as the SheevaPlug.
The quality is not as good as LAME but it's better than nothing.

Changes for use with Squeezebox Server:

Removed cross-compiling stuff from Makefile.
Added __arm__ check, the StrongARM asm works fine on ARMv5+

TODO:
stdin/stdout support 
See if it will work on ReadyNAS (big-endian issues, needs asm)
